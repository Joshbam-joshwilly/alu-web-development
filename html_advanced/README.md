creating an advanced project with just HTML.

Author: Joshua ALANA
School: AFRICAN LEADERSHIP UNIVERSITY.

We will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:
